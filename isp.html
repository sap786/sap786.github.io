    <h2 style="font-family: 'Rubik Burned', cursive;">A Description!</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Rubik Burned', cursive;">Last year, in Computer Science 1, I had the assignment to create some sort of game. My group and I decided to make a game that would captivate the attention of all the people that could possibly play it. As the brainstorming process started, we came to the conclusion that having a choice of your own adventure would keep everyone engaged. We started the process with coding by making a background and then linking each page to the other. It was quite simple but did the job really well and kept the crowd engaged for the entirety of our presentation. The code itself was quite simple too. Adding backgrounds to pages and hyperlinking each page to the next.
